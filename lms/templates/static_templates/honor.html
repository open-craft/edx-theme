    <h1>PearsonX Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Welcome to PearsonX, which is a global learning community that provides high quality education for students and professionals anywhere, anytime (“PearsonX”).  Please read these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy ("TOS") and Honor Code prior to registering for PearsonX.com or using any portion of the PearsonX website (the "Website," which consists of all content and pages located within the PearsonX.com web domain), including accessing any course material, chat rooms, or other electronic services.  These TOS and the Honor Code are agreements (the "Agreements") between You and PearsonX. By using the Website, You accept and agree to be legally bound by the Agreements, whether or not You are a registered user.  If You do not understand or do not agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the Agreements, please do not register for or otherwise access or use the Website.</p>
    <p>PearsonX reserves the right to modify the Agreements at any time without advance notice.  Any changes to the Agreements will be effective immediately upon posting on this page.  If You do not choose to accept the changes to the Agreements, You may cancel your access to the Website as described below in Section 11.3.  Continued use of the Website constitutes Your acceptance of the terms of the modified Agreements. Be sure to return to this page periodically to ensure familiarity with the most current version of these Agreements.</p>
    <h2>1. Description of PearsonX</h2>
    <p>PearsonX provides a learner journey that is designed to improve the learner experience and increase the likelihood of successful course and, if applicable, program completion.  These programs include opportunities to interact with subject matter experts, fellow students, advisors and other stakeholders.  This may also include individual assessment of a student's work and, for students who demonstrate their mastery of subjects, a certificate of achievement or other acknowledgment.  In some instances the content will be fully owned and delivered by PearsonX while in other cases PearsonX will design a value-added learner journey to accompany courses that are owned and distributed by third parties like edX.  Criteria for successful completion of the program shall be set by content owner.    </p>
    <p>PearsonX programs will be offered in a variety of configurations.  In some cases PearsonX will license programs from edX and host them entirely within our own learning environment.  In other cases, PearsonX will provide products and services designed to improve the learning experience on our server while directing the user to edX (USA) for the course level experience.</p>
    <h2>2. Registration and Payment </h2>
    <p>2.1. You will enroll in courses and programs and pay PearsonX directly via the PearsonX Website (https://courses.pearsonx.com/).  The processing of your payment information is done by a PearsonX third party vendor, and you will be re-routed to a secure website to complete the payment transaction.  A separate privacy statement posted at the payment landing page operated by such third party vendor will govern the submission and processing of your payment details. Please familiarize yourself with those terms prior to initiating a transaction.  Once your payment transaction is completed, you will receive an email receipt from our payment processor. Please retain this email for your records and contact your Student Advisor if you have problems. You will receive contact information for your Student Advisor during the registration process.</p>
    <p>2.2. If You enroll in an edX program, PearsonX will transfer payment over to edX for the Verified Certificate option.  A PearsonX Student Advisor will guide You through the edX Verified Certificate process which is required in order for students to earn the related PearsonX certificate.  In order to keep costs down for all students, we do not manage a refund process so once You register and pay for a PearsonX course there will be no refunds (see Section 11.1.)</p>
